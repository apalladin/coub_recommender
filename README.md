# coub_recommender


This repository displays the baseline approach to a COUB website of looped videos recommender system. The project employes the content-based, hybrid as well as collaborative filtering approaches. The input data are located in a respective folder. 

For this project you'll need `surprise`library as well as `coub-api` installed.
